# AI-Hair Assistant

AI-Hair Assistant is an AI-based web application that generates personalized hair care routines based on user-provided hair health details such as hair type, scalp condition, and specific hair problems. The project aims to make expert-like hair care guidance accessible, affordable, and easy to follow using artificial intelligence.

## Problem Statement
Many individuals face hair-related issues due to generic advice, lack of personalized guidance, and expensive professional consultations. Existing solutions often fail to consider individual hair conditions, leading to ineffective routines and confusion.

---

## Proposed Solution
AI-Hair Assistant solves this problem by analyzing user inputs and generating structured, step-by-step hair care routines using AI. The system adapts recommendations based on the user's hair condition, providing clear and actionable guidance without the need for professional visits.

## Features
- Personalized hair care routine generation  
- Support for multiple hair types and scalp conditions  
- Step-by-step daily and weekly routines  
- User-friendly web interface  
- Secure user authentication  
- Cloud-based architecture for scalability  

---

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Firebase Authentication  
- Firebase Firestore / Realtime Database  
- Firebase Hosting  
- Google AI Studio (Gemini API)

## Process Flow
1. User logs in or signs up  
2. User enters hair details  
3. System validates the input
